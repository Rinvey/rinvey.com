# About
Rynvei Technologies™ is an organization that develops software and hardware.
All of the products have a retro-futuristic focus, taking old ideas that have
been lost (like not always having to be connected to the internet, and not
eating large amounts of RAM) and combining them with the newest technology
(like RISC-V and Rust).  Rynvei Technologies™ also uses ZLib / Apache-2.0 dual
licensing for all open source projects, making it easy to fork and customize.
And, Rynvei uses dark theme default for everything!

# Contribute
If you want to contribute to this organization, it's really easy!  Make a PR or
issue on a GitHub project or send an email to aldaronlau@gmail.com if you have
an interest and experience in RISC-V hardware.  I don't expect some of these
projects to be ready for a very long time, and eventually, once it can be
monetarily sustained, Rynvei Technologies™ will become a non-profit.
